title: Machine Learning for Building AI Teaching Assistants Dulicate Question Detection
summary: Design and implementation of deep learning models for duplicate question detection
# An AI Teaching Assistant can answer duplicate questions with corresponding answers in our database. Therefore, how to detect duplicate questions accurately has been a major problem. In this project, we first introduce our baseline method, the vanilla GRU model, to detect duplicate questions. We then propose and analyze several methods to improve the accuracy. They can be divided into two categories: Improving the model, including using deeper neural network, LSTM networks, Convolutional neural networks, adding POS tags; Or creating augmented dataset, especially applying Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) to generating duplicate questions. Our bidrectional Gated Recurrent Network with augmented data achieved 0.859 accuracy and 0.859 F1 score on QUORA dataset.
